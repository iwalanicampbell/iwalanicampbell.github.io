## Specifics paths of software engineer
  What even is a software engineer? I've heard the phrase software engineer thrown about but I've never thought too much about what they do. They engineer the software right? But what makes them different from programmers, and a developer? Software engineers determine the best ways to develop and support their projects and processes; and compared to others, software engineers are more likely to work on computer systems as a whole. As a software engineer, you may work on backend or frontend programming.
  
## The union between software engineering and my interests
  After creating and editing my Techfolio website I am now interested in learning more UI. Overall I like seeing how my code interacts with others, and a huge part of the interaction would be UI. I would also be interested in learning more about servers, like SQL. Last year, I participated in a National Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition, during the competition we had a SQL database with fake personal identifiable information. Unfortunately, no one had any idea how to defend the database, and our fake data was stolen and held for Bitcoin ransom

## Experiences I hope for
  As previously stated I would be most interested in learning more about UI and databases. I hope to learn more about databases so that next time I have a SQL database during a cyber competition the hackers don't steal the fake data. Furthermore, I hope to flesh out my Techfolio website and make it more aesthetically pleasing. Lastly, I wish to develop enough skills so that I can get an on-campus web design or database job.
