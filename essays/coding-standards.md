## Computer standards vs Human standards
  
  No matter what coding language you code in, you will always have to juggle between computer standards and human standards.  Computer standards are easy enough, when you aren't within those standards the computer passive-aggressively underlines a big fat red line under what it doesn't like, or when you run the code it gives an angry error while refusing to run.  Human standards on the other hand aren't as much in your face when you miss them.  Human and computer standards are relatively the same, standards are set to maintain consistency.  Consistency is a key and important principle of coding, if your code isn't consistent in its results it could mean an airplane falls out of the sky. 
  
## ESLint
  
  In two of my computer sicence classes my professor was very big on coding standards however we did not have any tool or program to double check the coding standards which made it a bit difficult to find the coding standard probelms.  I think ESlint is extrmely helpful and I wish I had known that I could have gotten a tool to help me maintain coding standards in my other classes.  I don't think getting the green checkmark is too painful, ESLint is usually smart enough to know what to do and many of the errors are an easy F2 fix.   
  
## Learning and coding standards
  
  I think that coding standards can help you learn a programming language to a degree.  Some coding languages have reserved keywords that may have different functions.  As a beginner I would often get tripped up between the reserved keywords of the language vs my own variables or functions.  In this case coding standards helped me understand reserved keywords and how to properly name my own variables.
