  Over the past semester I learned a variety of software engineering concepts, but most importantly I experienced them. After ICS314 I have acquired experience with  web application development, with both soft skills and hard skills. The key takeaways from ICS314 for me was learning, Agile Project Management, Design Patterns, and Coding Standards.  
  
  
## Agile Project Management
  Throughout this course the concepts built upon eachother so that I could use them in the group project that would showcase both my soft and hard skills.  In completing my group project I have a deeper understanding on collaborating efficiently in a team. In Agile Project Management the project used Issue Driven Project Management, the project was broken down into milestones and tasks. Each milestone would have their own set of tasks and tasks are broken up into 3 different statuses to ensure that teammates are held responsible for their tasks. Then every person should have a task they are working on and several other tasks to complete to ensure that time is being use effectively. I thought this was a great way to divy up tasks since it makes sure people are held responsible for each task, and that not one person would do all the work. Creating established and effcient procedures for managing the project ensured our project's sucess and it will be something I will integrate next time I have a group project.
