## HTML and CSS
  
  In the beginning of this class we primarily used HTML and CSS to create our webpages, frankly using CSS and HTML the webpages looked less than ideal. Customization was hard and having simple centering was harder. I think raw HTML and CSS are hard to use on their own because you limit yourself to other premade modules. HTML and CSS are like the foundation of a house, it works at the ground level but I use tools like Bootstrap to customize the walls, roofs, decor, etc for different houses. Everyone has to have the same foundation but we all have different needs for our houses, and having standard tools is like making sure the houses are in regulation so that if other developers need to work on the house later they can do so without much headache.

## BootStrap
  
  Bootstrap has a lot of functionality compared to just raw HTML and CSS. Bootstrap gives users an overall standard of tools for developers so that they don't have to reinvent the wheel every time. As how I mentioned in the coding standards essay, developers need to have standards when it comes to coding, and having standardized tools is helpful for a company. I like how BootStrap is another tool for HTML and CSS and isn't a reinvention of it. Bootstrap has a lot of different functionality which can be a double-edged sword, there can be so much information when looking at BootStrap that it can be hard to figure out where to begin.  
  
  One thing I dislike about Bootstrap and HTML is that it can be hard to see and organize everything, for example, if you use multiple divs inside divs it can be hard to see where the start and end are. It is especially hard when you are trying to find and solve a problem nested inside multiple tags.   
  
## Investment and Benefits
  
  When you invest time and frustration into learning HTML and CSS you gain a pretty neat webpage.  The more blood, sweat, and tears you put the more aesthetically pleasing your webpage looks. Take for example the two screenshots of the webpages I built, the first one is made of raw HTML, CSS, and 40 minutes. The second one was made with BootStrap and a few hours. The difference is day and night. Through this module, I felt a sense of accomplishment seeing my finished webpages, which gave me a nice amount of serotonin to forget about the actual development process. It is beneficial to learn HTML and CSS as a developer since all websites run on it, even if you never touch HTML it is good to understand it.
