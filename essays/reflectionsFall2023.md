  Over the past semester, I learned a variety of foundational technical computer science concepts, and most importantly I was able to use technical concepts to explore my passion for cybersecurity. Leveraging courses such as ICS312, ICS332, and EE406, I laid a solid groundwork to tackle various lab projects found in <a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/Computer_Security.html?id=DI8szwEACAAJ">Computer Security: A Hands-on Approach.</a> Due to extenuating circumstances, I was not able to fully complete ICS332 that semester but what I learned was extremely useful. These courses provided invaluable insights, equipping me with a robust understanding of essential tools such as the command line, Linux, and Docker. Moreover, they fostered significant enhancement of my problem-solving abilities and my understanding of abstraction.  
    

In conclusion, studying assembly language not only deepened my understanding of low-level programming and optimized code execution but also fostered a great appreciation for the abstractions provided by higher-level languages. Exploring operating systems illuminated the intricate management of system resources, from process scheduling to memory allocation, while emphasizing the crucial balance between efficient low-level resource management and the convenience of higher-level abstractions.
