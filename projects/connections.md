summary: "A game based on the NYT Connections Game"
---

One of the only things my family enjoys doing together is playing Connections. [Connections](https://www.nytimes.com/games/connections), is a game by the New York Times where you must make 4 groups of 4 words based on the similarities the words have with one another.  Sometimes the similarities can be extremely niche like "Start of the Planets" (*I am still a bit salty about that group*) or extremely well-known.  Either way, the game is a brain-stimulating and fun game to play alone or with family and friends. The greatest form of flattery is imitation, so I decided to create my version. I wanted to incorporate some of my interests/minor so in this version, the words are in Chinese! If you don't know Chinese you can always translate the words or (*hint: You can hit F12 and look at the console if you need the answers*) [Play Here!](https://iwalanicampbell.github.io/connections.html)
