It can be hard to even know what kind of jobs are out there as a student! A solution to this problem is creating a discord bot that sends users USAJOB listings when prompted or on a recurring basis. This is a project currently in progress there are still features to implement and other things to iron out. I also have to figure out how I want to deploy this to a server...
