Ninja cat has you playing as a cat ninja while weaving through enemies like shiba-samurai or other obstacles.

Ninja cat was built using GameMaker Studio (https://steamcommunity.com/app/214850).  All art, code, and other foundations of the game was created by me. 
The game is not fully finished yet but I hope to finish it by the time I graduate.
